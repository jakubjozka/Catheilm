# What Could Be Added / What Wasn't Finished

I had several features planned that I didn’t manage to implement in time.

I wanted to expand the weapon variety by adding special effects, such as poison or charge attacks, where a weapon can’t be used for one turn but deals massive damage on the next.
Another planned addition was magic.
This would include a mana bar showing how many spells the player can still cast, along with a spell system where the player learns new spells as they progress through the game.

Currently, the player has six attributes, but only two are actively used. Here are the ideas for expanding the others:
1. Strength – increases weapon damage, potentially changing which dice the player rolls.
2. Intelligence – boosts magic damage and increases maximum mana.
3. Wisdom – unlocks new spells for the player.
4. Charisma – lowers market prices and could influence certain monsters, such as reducing their Dexterity.
Right now, attribute leveling is limited: each level-up randomly upgrades Dexterity or Constitution. A better approach would be to let the player choose. For example, after each level-up, a button could appear next to each attribute, allowing them to decide which one to improve.

Also, the UI needs a complete overhaul. 
Currently, each section is marked with random colors. I envisioned a yellow, paper-like background with brown, squiggly divider lines between sections, giving the interface a “scroll” or “old manuscript” theme.
